    <h1>About pets</h1>
    <p>Hey you, let's talk about pets. A pet is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive appearances, intelligence and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics. Do you have a pet?</P>

    <h2>My Pet</h2>
    <p>Well I have a pet. It's so wild  and goofy. The last time someone visited it growled so heavy and willd. I don't know why but it waits till when there are very many people and the exact time where everyone is silent. Then it sets out a loud growl. Ever embarassing coz when it sets out, no one can stop it. I think that is its favorite activity; cause embarrassments. Sure by now you are wondering what my pet is. Let me save you the suspense. Wait for it. Drum rolls..... My <em>tummy</em> hehe!</p>
